<b><h2>Implementation 1:</b></h2>
Here's a high-level overview of the steps to implement data ingestion using Azure Data Factory and loading into Azure Synapse Analytics:

<b><h2>Create an Azure Data Factory:</b></h2> Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Data Factory.

<b><h2>Create a Source:</b></h2> In the Azure Data Factory, create a new data source to connect to the data you want to ingest. You can use a wide variety of sources such as on-premise databases, cloud-based data sources, or file-based systems.

<b><h2>Create a Pipeline:</b></h2> Create a new pipeline in the Azure Data Factory, which will be used to move data from the source to the Azure Synapse Analytics.

<b><h2>Add a Copy Activity:</b></h2> In the pipeline, add a copy activity to copy data from the source to Azure Synapse Analytics.

<b><h2>Configure the Copy Activity:</b></h2> In the copy activity, configure the source and the destination details, mapping columns, and any necessary transformations.

<b><h2>Trigger the Pipeline:</b></h2> Trigger the pipeline to run, which will move the data from the source to Azure Synapse Analytics.

<b><h2>Verify the Data Load:</b></h2> Verify that the data has been loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics.
