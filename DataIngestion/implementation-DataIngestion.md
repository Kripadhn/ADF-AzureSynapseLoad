Here is an example of implementing data ingestion using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and loading the data into Azure Synapse Analytics with code and data:

<b><h3>Create an Azure Data Factory:</b></h3> Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Data Factory.

<b><h3>Create a Data Source:</b></h3> In the Azure Data Factory, create a data source. This could be a file-based source like a CSV or a database like Azure SQL Database.

<b><h3>Create a Data Set:</b></h3> In the Azure Data Factory, create a data set that points to the data source created in step 2.

<b><h3>Create a Pipeline:</b></h3> In the Azure Data Factory, create a pipeline that contains a copy activity. The copy activity reads data from the data set created in step 3 and loads it into Azure Synapse Analytics.

<b><h3>Copy Data:</b></h3> In the Azure Data Factory, run the pipeline created in step 4 to copy the data from the data set to Azure Synapse Analytics.


In this example, <dataSetName> and <synapseTableName> are placeholders for the names of the data set and the Azure Synapse Analytics table, respectively. The columnMappings section maps the columns in the source data to the columns in the target table.
