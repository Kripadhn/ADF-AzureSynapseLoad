Here is an example of loading transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics tables using code:

Create a Synapse SQL Pool: In the Azure portal, create a new Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, and then create a new Synapse SQL pool.

Create a Table: In the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, create a new table in the Synapse SQL pool. This table will store the transformed data.

Write a Stored Procedure: In the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, write a stored procedure in T-SQL that will load the transformed data into the table created in step 2. The stored procedure should include the following steps:

a. Drop the table if it already exists.

b. Create the table with the appropriate schema.

c. Use the BULK INSERT command to load the transformed data into the table.

Create an Azure Data Factory: Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Data Factory.

Create a Pipeline: In the Azure Data Factory, create a pipeline that contains a SQL Server stored procedure activity. The SQL Server stored procedure activity runs the stored procedure created in step 3 to load the transformed data into the Synapse SQL pool.

Run the Pipeline: In the Azure Data Factory, run the pipeline created in step 5 to run the stored procedure and load the transformed data into the Synapse SQL pool.

-----

LoadData.json:-
In this example, <previousActivity> is the name of the activity that runs before the SQL Server stored procedure activity, <transformedDataSet> is the name of the data set that contains the transformed data, <storedProcedureName> is the name of the stored procedure created in step 3, and <parameter1> and <parameter2> are placeholders for parameters that can be passed to the stored procedure. The values of these parameters are specified in the storedProcedureParameters section.
