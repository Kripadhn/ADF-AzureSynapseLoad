Here is an example of loading transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics tables using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and code:

Create an Azure Data Factory: Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Data Factory.

Create a Data Set: In the Azure Data Factory, create a data set that points to the transformed data. This could be stored in Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, or any other storage location.

Create a Destination Table: In Azure Synapse Analytics, create the table where the transformed data will be loaded.

Create a Copy Activity: In the Azure Data Factory, create a pipeline that contains a Copy activity. The Copy activity copies the transformed data from the source to the destination table in Azure Synapse Analytics.


--------------

LoadTransformedData.json:-
In this example, <dataSetName> is the name of the data set created in step 2, <synapseTableName> is the name of the Azure Synapse Analytics table where the advanced transformed data will be loaded, Overwrite is the copy behavior, which means the existing data in the destination table will be overwritten, writeBatchSize is the number of rows to write in a single batch, writeBatchTimeout is the time after which a batch write operation times out, sqlWriterStoredProcedureName is the name of the stored procedure that will be used to write the data to the destination table, DerivedColumnTransformer is the type of transformer that will be used to perform advanced data transformations, and columnMappings is an array of transformations to be performed on the columns, where inputColumn is the name of the input column, outputColumn is the name of the output column, and expression is the transformation expression
