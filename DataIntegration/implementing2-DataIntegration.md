Here is an example of integrating data from multiple sources into Azure Synapse Analytics using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and code:

Create an Azure Data Factory: Go to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Data Factory.

Create Data Sets: In the Azure Data Factory, create data sets for each of the data sources. For example, if you have data in Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database, create two data sets, one for each data source.

Create a Destination Table: In Azure Synapse Analytics, create the table where the integrated data will be loaded.

Create a Copy Activity: In the Azure Data Factory, create a pipeline that contains a Copy activity. The Copy activity copies the data from the data sets to the destination table in Azure Synapse Analytics.


----------------

IntegrateData.json:-
In this example, <blobDataSetName> and <sqlDataSetName> are the names of the data sets created in step 2, <synapseTableName> is the name of the Azure Synapse Analytics table where the integrated data will be loaded, Merge is the copy behavior, which means new rows will be inserted and existing rows will be updated, writeBatchSize is the number of rows to write in a single batch, writeBatchTimeout is the time after which a batch write operation times out, and sqlWriterStoredProcedureName is the name of the stored procedure that will be used to write the data to the destination table.
