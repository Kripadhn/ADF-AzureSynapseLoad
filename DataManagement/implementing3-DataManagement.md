To manage and monitor data pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can use the following features:

Pipeline monitoring: ADF provides an overview of pipeline execution, including the status of each activity, start and end times, and any error messages. You can also view details of each pipeline run, including inputs and outputs, as well as performance metrics.

Alerts: You can create alerts that notify you when pipeline execution fails or when it takes longer than expected.

Auditing: ADF provides auditing for pipeline execution, including who ran the pipeline and when, as well as the inputs and outputs for each activity.

-------------------

In this example, the CopyData activity is the name of the copy activity, inputDatasetName and outputDatasetName are the references to the input and output datasets, respectively. The timeout property sets the maximum time that the activity is allowed to run. The retry property sets the number of times the activity will retry if it fails, and retryIntervalInSeconds sets the number of seconds between retries. The Monitoring annotation enables monitoring for the pipeline.

You can also use the Azure portal or the Azure Monitor REST API to monitor and manage your data pipelines.
