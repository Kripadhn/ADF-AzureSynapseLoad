To manage and monitor data pipelines in Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can use the following features:

Debugging: ADF provides debugging capabilities to help you troubleshoot pipeline issues. You can use the Debug session feature to test pipeline activities and view the activity outputs and execution details.
