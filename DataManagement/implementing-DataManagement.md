To manage and monitor data pipelines using Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can use the following features:

Monitoring: You can monitor the status of your pipelines, activities, and data movements using the Azure portal, where you can view detailed information about the pipeline runs and monitor the success or failure of individual activities.

Alerts: You can set up alerts to receive notifications when specific conditions occur during pipeline execution, such as a failure of a specific activity or when a pipeline run takes longer than expected.

Logging: You can enable logging for your pipelines to capture detailed information about pipeline execution, including any errors or warnings. You can view the logs in the Azure portal or export them for further analysis.


------------

logging.json:-
In this example, logLevel is the level of logging to be captured, sendToDiagnosticLog specifies whether to send the logs to the Azure Diagnostic Log, and storageAccountId specifies the ID of the storage account where the logs will be stored.

By using these features, you can monitor the pipeline execution and take appropriate actions to resolve any issues that arise during pipeline execution.
